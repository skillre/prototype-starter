/**
 * Playwright config — Factory v1.1.
 *
 * PORT ISOLATION (the important part)
 * -----------------------------------
 * v1.0.0 pointed `baseURL` and `webServer.url` at `http://localhost:3000` and set
 * `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI`. That combination has a specific, nasty
 * failure mode: Playwright's readiness probe is a plain HTTP GET whose success
 * condition is `200 <= status < 404`, and when it succeeds while
 * `reuseExistingServer` is truthy, Playwright returns immediately **without
 * checking that the responder is this app**. Port 3000 is Next's default, so a
 * stale dev server — or any sibling prototype — answering `/` would be adopted as
 * the app under test, and the whole suite could go green against the wrong page.
 *
 * (The sibling prototypes already work around this: hub pins 3100, finance pins
 * 3210, and finance's config comment names *this* repo's 3000 as the hazard.)
 *
 * Factory v1.1 therefore:
 *   - pins a dedicated port that is not 3000 and not another prototype's
 *     (`QA_PORT` in `.qa/qa.config.mjs` — one source of truth),
 *   - pins the dev server to that port explicitly, so Next can never auto-bump
 *     to 3201 while `baseURL` still points at 3200,
 *   - sets `reuseExistingServer: false` unconditionally — the server is always
 *     started and always stopped by this run, so teardown can only ever kill a
 *     process we own,
 *   - leaves an occupied port to the pre-flight guard
 *     (`scripts/check-qa-port.mjs`, wired into the `test` script), which fails
 *     loudly and names the process instead of letting Playwright hang for 180s.
 *
 * Run it through `pnpm test` so the guard executes first; running
 * `pnpm exec playwright test` directly skips the guard (Playwright will still
 * refuse to reuse, it just reports less helpfully).
